# Interaction
- Run find_movie.py in the command window.
- First, the program will ask the user to choose between the movie runtimes: (1)<=90 min (2)>90 min.
- Second, the program will ask the user to choose movie from desired years: (1)<=1980 (2)1980~2000 (3)>2000.
- Third, the program will prompt  a list of movie genres for the user to choose from, such as Crime, Drama, Comedy etc.
- Once the user made all the choices, the program will provide a list of 10 movies(if there is less than 10 movies, list all the movie)ranked by their IMDB ratings and indexed by number from 1 to 10. 
- User can then type the number before the movie to see the plot , rated and the poster link of the movie, and the program will also automatically use the web browser module to open the posterURL embedded by the JSON item description.
